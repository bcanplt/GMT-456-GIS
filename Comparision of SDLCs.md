Lean: Inspired by lean manufacturing practices and principles. The focus is on what is being worked on at that moment, so that no unnecessary work is done. There is no room for multitasking. It is based on ensuring customer satisfaction by eliminating waste.

Waterfall: Considered the oldest configured SDLC model. It also has a fairly simple approach. Without going back, one stage is completed and the next stage is passed.

Spiral: It is one of the most flexible models and goes through four stages until the end of the project. While it is generally used in large projects, the advantage is that it provides convenience in risk management.
